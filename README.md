# redux-shop-shop

## Description
Shop-Shop is an ecommerce app aimed at online shopping. The frontend of the application is developed using React and React Context API.  In this project I aimed to refactor the code and replace Context API functionality with Redux.

## Objectives
* Understand and implement basic concepts of Redux  library for state management.

## User Story
* AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

## Mock Up
* GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
* WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
* WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
* WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
* WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
* WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
